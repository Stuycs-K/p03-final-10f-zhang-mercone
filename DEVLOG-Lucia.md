### 2026-01-06 - Worked on proposal
- Worked out proposal of project in class: which files are necessary, overall plan
  - Client: Handles client-side interaction
  - Server:
  - GameLogic: Handles game-related functions, hooks into both client and server.
    The intention was to have this section be separate, so as to be more easily
    replaced/modified in case we change our minds/something comes up.
  - Leaderboard: Should handle reading/writing to file so as to store a score.
      - Could store based on IP, PID, or client ID (discuss)
  - Networking: handles networking protocols.


### 2026-01-07 - Created skeleton of project
- Added necessary headers to files
- Added commenting on files + small edits
- Added further functions and a bit of the code for client
